# FreeAgent Coding Challenge

Thank you for your interest in the FreeAgent Coding Challenge.  This template is a barebones guide to get you started.  Please add any gems, folders, files, etc. you see fit in order to produce a solution you're proud of.

## Coding Challenge Instructions

Please see the INSTRUCTIONS.md file for more information.

## Your Solution Setup and Run Instructions

1. Installed Ruby with rbenv
2. Installed version 2.5.3
3. Switched Mac to use this version $ rbenv local 2.5.3 - this was actually a blocker for a while to get RubyGems installed until I noticed my Mac was using an old version and figured out how to switch to the new version
4. Set up a git repo so I could track my changes and roll back if required

## Your Design Decisions
1. Decided to put validation on user input, if a new source currency is added then the access to it ideally should be the same way, alternatively validation could be put on each source currency for user input


We'd love to hear your thoughts around any design decisions you made while coding your solution.
